# Custom Logistic Regression with Statistical Inference

This repository contains a custom implementation of Logistic Regression using the **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)** algorithm, along with extensive **statistical inference tools** inspired by **R's `glm()`**.

Below is the checklist of implemented and pending features.

---

## ❌ Features Not Yet Implemented (more to less important)

- [ ] **`step()` stepwise variable selection based on AIC**  
- [ ] **Categorical variable handling (GLM-style, not one hot)**
- [ ] **L2 regularisation ??? we apply this in the IRLS, i have to ask lluis where to apply it further**
