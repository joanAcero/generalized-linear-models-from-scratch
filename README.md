# Custom Logistic Regression with Statistical Inference

This repository contains a custom implementation of Logistic Regression using the **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)** algorithm, along with extensive **statistical inference tools** inspired by **R's `glm()`**.

Below is the checklist of implemented and pending features.

## Experimental part:

- [ ] Test it (against the R and Python routines), maybe you can improve its speed! 
- [ ] Apply it to a biomedical problem (doctors love Logistic Regression).
